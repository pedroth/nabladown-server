# Nabladown server

Nabladown server is a computer application that lets you view [nabladown][nabla] files, through a hot reloading.

# Quickstart

Simplest way to run this is to use `npx`:

`npx nabladown-server`

Then open browser at `http://localhost:3000`. It will display a list of all `.nd` files, in the folder where the first command was ran.

You can also use `bunx`

`bunx nabladown-server`

> If there is some error try to install it first globally using `bun i -g nabladown-server`
